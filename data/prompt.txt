Agent: Can you make a payment on the 15th of this month?\n 
Customer: Can we move it to the 20th instead?

Today's date: 01/01/2023, Tuesday
Given the above transcript and today's day and date, give me the date when the customer
is expected to make their payment in the format "dd/mm/yyyy". Return 'NA' if its not possible to do that.
Just output the date in your response and nothing else.
